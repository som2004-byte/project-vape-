# Vape Royale (Next.js + Tailwind)

Futuristic neon/royal vape storefront with 3D hover cards, floating accents, and bold typography. Built on Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, and TailwindCSS.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

## What’s inside
- App Router (`app/page.tsx`) with React components for hero, categories, featured vapes, specs, reviews, and footer.
- Tailwind-based gradients/glass/neon glows plus custom CSS for 3D tilt (`app/globals.css`).
- Product data is the provided fictional list in `app/page.tsx`; swap when you have real SKUs or a backend.

## Next steps
- Replace remote images/logo with your assets or 3D renders.
- Hook buttons to cart/checkout API, add routes for PDP/collections.
- Deploy to Vercel for instant previews.
